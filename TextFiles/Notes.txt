"It can be argued that now in the 21st century our public spaces have been saturated with advertising, which we must not forget is the capture of public space by private interests."


- Reclaim private space for the benefit of the public through interactive installations


"Mediatecture" - Hybridization of architecture, urban design, media, and new technology
- "dynamic properties that allow for dynamic, reactive, or interactive behavior"
- "integrating physical and information space"


First public display of projection mapping: 1969 Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland


Projection mapping softwares: MadMapper, TouchDesigner
- "The technology is still new so people still have the capacity to be amazed by [projected] animations by a skilled programmer"
- "Can be used to create a spectacle that influences how spectators perceive existing space"


Phenomenology - "By creating a unique bodily experience for my observers I would like to communicate the essence, or intrinsic nature of the the design,  which will determine the character of the experience."
- "We must also consider how the wider context in which the design is shown also influences the experience from the perspective of the viewer."


Section 2.2, Experience and Atmosphere, is very good.
